Loan Level Analysis of Lending Club Data

The purpose of this analysis was to demonstrate knowledge of Credit Risk and Credit Bureau Data.  Annualized return (net of servicing fees, recovery fees, and gross losses) was calculated and used as a target variable for machine learning / statistical modeling techniques.

All available Loan Level data from Lending Club was downloaded from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action.  Data needs to be unzipped only (no other modifications) and placed in a "Data" folder where ever notebooks are run from.

Note that to get all fields including FICO, you'll need to start a LendingClub.com account and login when downloading the data.
